## 1 Intention & Background

When I began to study in the Physics Department of Peking University, I found myself not intersted in my major at all. During the period of exploring and learning, I was really surprised to realize I was keen on computer science. So I stepped on a journey to learn relative courses by myself, hoping that one day I may also make some contribution to this aspect. However, it's easier said than done. I met with tons of bewildering problems during this process, which made me doubt whether I really could learn by myself, and whether I could eventually succeed.

Thankfully, I turned to one of my CS teacher for help, who helped me with ardor and recommended me with two seniors. One told me the secret to his success in his research area; another introduced me with the cs-self-learning repository. Both the teacher and those two seniors fueled the light of hope with their selflessness. I began to study by myself again.

I took down notes carefully when studying. With the the content of my notes getting more and more, I suddenly thought:"Hey, wouldn't it be nice to integrate all the course notes I've taken and publish them on my website, so that others may refer to this when they are stuck like me?" That is how this note comes with luck. It may not be that accurate and perfect as you wish, but I will try my best to make it better.

## 2 Advice

1. The author of the notes is not an EECS student, and some errors and mistakes cannot be avoided. Sorry for any inconvenience it might cause.

2. Some of the pictures in the notes come from Wikipedia. Out of consideration of copyright, I didn't modify the pictures. However, some of them do not have background, which cannot be seen clearly in the dark theme. The notes are in the dark theme by default; it is highly recommended that you turned into light mode by clicking the button on the left side of the search bar.

3. The notes will be released in the form of pdf article. You will see it in the release part.

4. Thank you for your reading! Everyone is welcome to discuss with me via email.

## 6 Acknowledgements

Above all, I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to all those professors and TAs in the list above, who selflessly imparting his profound knowledge to us beginners, and made those learning resources public to everyone. The valuable knowledge has benefited me a lot and will be unforgettable for my whole life.

In addition, I'd like to express thanks to all those teachers and seniors who help me during my self-learning process.

Lastly, I'd like to reserve this part for my mother. For all these years, she has dedicated her life to nurture me, and . We have experiencd all those ups and downs together; it is incredibly hard to raise me under so much hard circumstances, and she has sacrificed all of herself to bring me up. During all this process of learning computer science myself, she always have my back, no matter what difficullties I encounter. This repository is certainly not even a little success, but I want to accredit everything I achieve to her sacrifice and hard work, without which I cannot accomplish anything.
